# Website-Blocker
I have made this program in python language.
I have used time module.
The main purpose of this program is to block website while one is studying or working.
I have declared 9:00 am (IST) to 15:00 pm (IST) as the working hours so at this interval of time the websites will be blocked.
When the work hour is ended then it will automatically wnblock the website.
As this program is writing in the host file of windows which can be only edited by the admin user, it requires admin previlages otherwise this program will not work.
